            <p>I know it's not much, but this website was something I had to learn myself to write in HTML and CSS, or at least understand it enough to use premade tools like Bootstrap to organize content the way I want it to. I hope it conveys the fact that I will always try to do slightly more than necessary; instead of using pre-made tools like Wix or SquareSpace, I learned a new skill and used it to showcase my other skills.</p>

            <p>That's not to say I'm at all a professional developer, but I find it helps to have some skin in the game to motivate yourself to get better. Perhaps in the future this website will have more complicated functions, or redirect you to more ambitious projects, but for now, hopefully it's aesthetically pleasing to at least browse around. And if not, you can suggest things by contacting me using the Contact tab.</p>

           <h2>Learning a new language - Italian</h2>

            <p>I was born in Pakistan and moved to Canada when I was almost 9 years old, so I can speak Urdu and English quite well, but I've always been intrigued by Italian. Not only is it fun to speak with exaggerated hand gestures, but I'm also into a lot of Italian culture. Shows like the Sopranos, Goodfellas, Gladiator, & Leonardo are some of my favorite, and I really enjoy Italian cuisine like lasagna, pasta, and pizza. Going to Italy is one of my dream goals, and I'm learning Italian through Duolingo, which "gamifies" learning a new language. So far I know how to order a few basic items in a restaurant, ask people where they're from, buy a few things in a store, etc. My goal is to reach a day streak of 500, which I will update here if I reach that goal.</p>

            <p>I used to read a lot of books in middle school (The Outsiders, The Giver, Animal Farm, several Goosebumps stories, etc), but entering high school and University, I didn't feel the need to read for leisure. A small part of it can be explained due to the rise of internet sites that give you the summary and analysis of each book, and for a long time, I didn't see any value in reading itself. That has somewhat changed since graduating University; I see reading as a way to hone my attention and focusing skills, to follow the thought process of the author, and read the subtext of certain passages. I'm currently enjoying Vaclav Smil's "How the world really works", which explains at a high level how globalization works. I was particularly astounded when he mentions that the world economy runs on 4 primary materials: concrete, steel, plastic, and ammonia, all of which rely on fossil fuels to be obtained. Efficiencies in obtaining these materials, or being less reliant on fossil fuels, can lead to a sustainable future. Truly a fantastic read. In the future, I'd be interested in reading "The Psychology of Money", by Morgan Housel, who describes the behavioral economics (or mental accounting) of everyday people, and how to use saving and investing techniques to build a financially independent life.</p>

            <p>This is a course I'm trying to do in Udemy, run by Angela Yu, which covers almost all of the basics of Python and it's available libraries, and there's a few projects from it that are available on my GitHub. I'll update this section after I finish all of it, but overall I'm enjoying the course. My favorite project so far was the snake game using tkinter library.</p>
