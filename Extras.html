            <p>I know it's not much, but this website was something I had to learn myself to write in HTML and CSS, or at least understand it enough to use premade tools like Bootstrap to organize content the way I want it to. I hope it conveys the fact that I will always try to do slightly more than necessary; instead of using pre-made tools like Wix or SquareSpace, I learned a new skill and used it to showcase my other skills.</p>

            <p>That's not to say I'm at all a professional developer, but I find it helps to have some skin in the game to motivate yourself to get better. Perhaps in the future this website will have more complicated functions, or redirect you to more ambitious projects, but for now, hopefully it's aesthetically pleasing to at least browse around. And if not, you can suggest things by contacting me using the Contact tab.</p>

           <h2>Custom Enclosure - Mechanical Calculator</h2>
              <h3></h3>

            <p>In a world before computers, math functions were done in the mind. When humanity got bored of that, they invented mechanical calculators that used a series of dials, accumulator gears, and pinion wheels to help add or subtract large numbers, and for one of my manufacturing courses, re-designing an old model of those mechanical calculators was the task. Like with everything, we applied the engineering design methodology to identify shortfalls and come up with new ideas, while taking into account any constraints.</p>

            <p>But just designing it is child's play for a 4th year course, so to build a prototype we not only had limited resources, but had to show our work outside of CAD models. For example, we were given 3 identically sized MDF boards that had to be cut on a milling machine, shown in MasterCAM. But we only had a one sized spindle, meaning that to make small gears, the resolution was not enough for it to be made out of MDF and thus had to 3D printed and shown as an STL file.</p>

            <p>Overall it was a great project, and one of the things I hope to do again and get more experience with is making custom enclosures. The casing of the calculator that I made in MasterCAM needed to be divided into 3 MDF boards, as just one was not long enough. Connecting the front and back pieces together, with no interference with any of the gears, pinion wheels, or the cutout showing the dial was an amazing feeling after I finished the project. It made me appreciate how easy technology makes things, as the entire point of MasterCAM is to write G-code for complex procedures; a programming language used to instruct various machining tools. </p>

           <h2>2-stage gearbox</h2>
              <h3>A quintessential mechanical engineering project</h3>       
           <section>
        
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6"> 
            <p>This project was very self-explanatory, design a 2 stage gearbox and document all the important process plans. This took place over the course of the whole semester, so it allowed our group to apply the knowledge learned in the "Topics in Manufacturing Engineering" course as we learned it.</p>

            <p>The project started with first researching the appropriate manufacturing process for the gearbox, as we looked at 3rd parties that specialized in gearboxes and inquired about part sourcing/manufacturing. We also looked at the Machinery's Handbook to pick good materials for the given loads/torque the gearbox was meant to handle. Afterwards, a typical CAD model was made in Solidworks. </p>

            <p>But the project went further as it asked for specific manufacturing processes and tolerances, as not all the parts were COTS (it was assumed that we'd purchase the machinery to make the custom parts like the casing). This is where Geometric Dimension and Tolerancing (GD&T) was used to specify how accurate we'd want the parts to be, and how they should be made. GD&T is a system for defining/communicating engineering tolerances, and it's based on datums/reference points of the part that are crucial to it's function (the flatness of a brick for example is important as it dictates how level a wall is). Lastly, a process plan that showed how the part would be manufactured was also made, to reduce any errors or misconceptions at the shop. </p>
