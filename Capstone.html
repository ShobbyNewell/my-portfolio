          </div>
          <p>Microfluidics is the study of particles and their behaviours at the micro-scale, where surface forces dominate volumetric forces. Because of this, there are "microfluidic lab on a chip systems" where fluids can be analyzed such as those in single cell studies, DNA sequencing, and drug testing. While lab-on-a-chip systems in general cover analyzing and processing fluids at the micro-scale, it’s the
          geometry that exploits the physical phenomena to achieve the mixing, sampling, dispensing, and separating particles at that scale that brings interest to other fields from physics and engineering backgrounds.</p>

          <p>Our group was tasked to create new microfluidic channel geometry that'd separate particles of different size and density by exploiting those physical phenomena "passively", or without changing the properties of the particles. This meant some research had to be done for the physical phenomena that made it possible, and work out how to design geometry around it. Thankfully, with the help of Dr.Scott Tsai, a Harvard graduate and expert of the field, we were able to come up with the following concepts:  </p>

        <p>These concepts were tested on a piece of software called COMSOL MultiPhysics, a finite element solver that in our case solves Navier Stokes equations for those geometries after initial velocity profiles and boundary conditions are set. It basically takes any CAD element of the geometry one gives it, breaks it into meshes predetermined by the user, and the nodes are where the equations are solved. The more complex the size and density of the mesh, the more accurate results one gets, at the cost of longer processing times.           
        </p>

        <p> All of the concepts were tested with the same 2 particles of different size and equivalent weight, and were tested with similar flow conditions. Concept 1 uses spiral geometry that takes advantage of inertial forces acting on the smaller particles to be separated from the bigger ones due to a pressure difference. This seperation is used to separate them further with cross-flow filters at the end of the geometry. Concept 2 uses a serpentine geometry which uses centrifugal and viscous drag forces that with every alternate movement (in a zig-zag) focus the particles more in their equilibrium positions. There's also expansion-contraction areas that use the radial forces acting on the particles for better separation. Lastly, Concept 3 has a pinched segment and symmetrically placed outlets to separate particles in a uniformly distributed fluid flow. Centrifugal and drag forces act on the particles at the 90 degree corner and sedimentation forces act on the particles after the pinched channel which further enhances particle separation.
        </p>

        <p> The best concept was picked based on separation distance, convergence testing, time to reach the 1000 particles/second benchmark, and overall complexity. Concept 2 was the winner in terms of overall least complexity and highest separation distance.
        </p>

        <p>If you feel somewhat lost in reading all of that, fret not, our group made a video summarizing everything:</p>
