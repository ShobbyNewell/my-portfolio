          <p>Almost every mechanical engineer needs a good car project, and I have two that I'd like to share:</p>

           <h2>Gravity Powered Car</h2>       
           <section>
        
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6"> 
           <p>Even though this project was done in high school, it costed our group a fair bit of money to make and design, and taught me a lot about working well with others. This "gravity" car uses a falling mass's potential energy to turn a driveshaft and thus, move a car. It was done for an Advanced Placement Physics project, and like most high school projects, we had over-ambitious goals for this project to make it drive the furthest in a final competition. While most of the other groups were using wooden boards as their frame, we used styrofoam cut out like a surfboard to say that we at least considered aerodynamics. We tried to place the vertical boards holding the pulley and mass so the center of mass could be positioned near the rear axles to reduce overall weight transfer during acceleration. We even got custom wood boards cut using our school's woodshop to save on weight, but even with all of that, a day before the competition, the car just didn't work. </p>      
           <p>You see, what had happened up to now was that two of the group members had done the majority of the building, while the other member and I worked on calculations, dimensions, and the final report. Having learned little about group communication, we decided that even though the car didn't work we'd still meet together again a few hours before the competition. It didn't help because the other group member and I didn't know everything the other 2 had tried, and those other 2 members were already bummed out and had lost hope. Our car didn't move at all during the competition, and the 2 members who had spent time building it went out with a defeated look on their face. Our physics teacher, however, said that if we could get it to run by the end of the school day, he'd consider it when grading.</p>

           <p>And that's when the other group member and I went to work. In about a half hour, when everyone else was at their lunch break, we went to the wood workshop, switched the wheel axles, adjusted the tension of the pulley, and tied down the mechanism connecting the hanging mass and the rear axle. The video below was our first attempt at making it move, and it's one of the single most satisfying moments of my life:</p>

           <p>After that, I learned that one cannot disregard the importance of group communication. If we had kept each other up to date, one of us would've eventually saw the issue of why the car wasn't moving, and it's not to put down another's intelligence, but rather how one can be oblivous to simple solutions when stressed with over-ambitious goals. It's important to keep everyone in the know about the end goal, and having self-imposed constraints about weight or center of mass can sometimes make you forget about the basic systems that should be in check along the way.</p>

           <h2>Elastic Powered Car</h2>          
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Compared to the previous project, this one went a lot better. Our group had some experience with engineering design from past courses, and knew the importance of group communication. This project was for a course called "Manufacturing Fundamentals", but making a car powered by elastic potential energy wasn't the main point. Designing it, accounting for tolerances as some parts had to be cut from an MDF acrylic board, understanding material strengths, gear ratios, etc were the main focus. Using engineering design we were able to identify different systems of the car, make a morphological chart to organize it, visualize concepts, evaluate the best one, and even make a prototype before going full scale. And because this project happened gradually over the semester, all of the group members were able to keep up with any new developments, and apply new information that was being taught on the side, like gear ratios and tolerance grades.</p>
            <p>The car worked by rotating a lever which would spin the elastic band connected to a thin paperclip connected to a small gear. When spun enough and let go, the elastic band would spin the small gear connected to a larger gear fixed to the rear axle, making the car move. This way, because of the gear ratios, the car had a lot of torque, which would help in the hill climb portion of the final race. The elastic band could also be attached to the larger output gear itself, causing a higher speed that'd be beneficial to the distance portion of the final test.</p>

            <p>We spent a lot of time on engineering calculations in relation to energy transfer, aerodynamic efficiency, and center of mass placement so we would do well in the race. Again, the final race consisted of a hill climb and distance test, and while we didn't end up winning first place due to a certain group member not winding the elastic enough, it still went better than the gravity car did initially. As always, you can read the paper for yourself, although note that the CAD models don't have some elements like the elastic band on it as it wasn't required for the report.</p>
