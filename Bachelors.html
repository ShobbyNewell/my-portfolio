          <p>
            Here I go through a few courses I did during my Bachelors at Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University). I was in the Mechanical Engineering department, and most of my classes were at George Vari. I also have a few high school course projects here, which made me fall in love with engineering in the first place.

            <h2 text-align: left>01: Capstone Project: Microfluidic Particle Separation</h2>
          </div>
          <p>Microfluidics is the study of particles and their behaviours at the micro-scale, where surface forces dominate volumetric forces. Because of this, there are "microfluidic lab on a chip systems" where fluids can be analyzed such as those in single cell studies, DNA sequencing, and drug testing. While lab-on-a-chip systems in general cover analyzing and processing fluids at the micro-scale, it’s the
          geometry that exploits the physical phenomena to achieve the mixing, sampling, dispensing, and separating particles at that scale that brings interest to other fields from physics and engineering backgrounds.</p>

          <p>Our group was tasked to create new microfluidic channel geometry that'd separate particles of different size and density by exploiting those physical phenomena "passively", or without changing the properties of the particles. This meant some research had to be done for the physical phenomena that made it possible, and work out how to design geometry around it. Thankfully, with the help of Dr.Scott Tsai, a Harvard graduate and expert of the field, we were able to come up with the following concepts:  </p>

      <section>
        <p>These concepts were tested on a piece of software called COMSOL MultiPhysics, a finite element solver that in our case solves Navier Stokes equations for those geometries after initial velocity profiles and boundary conditions are set. It basically takes any CAD element of the geometry one gives it, breaks it into meshes predetermined by the user, and the nodes are where the equations are solved. The more complex the size and density of the mesh, the more accurate results one gets, at the cost of longer processing times.           
        </p>

        <p> All of the concepts were tested with the same 2 particles of different size and equivalent weight, and were tested with similar flow conditions. Concept 1 uses spiral geometry that takes advantage of inertial forces acting on the smaller particles to be separated from the bigger ones due to a pressure difference. This seperation is used to separate them further with cross-flow filters at the end of the geometry. Concept 2 uses a serpentine geometry which uses centrifugal and viscous drag forces that with every alternate movement (in a zig-zag) focus the particles more in their equilibrium positions. There's also expansion-contraction areas that use the radial forces acting on the particles for better separation. Lastly, Concept 3 has a pinched segment and symmetrically placed outlets to separate particles in a uniformly distributed fluid flow. Centrifugal and drag forces act on the particles at the 90 degree corner and sedimentation forces act on the particles after the pinched channel which further enhances particle separation.
        </p>

        <p> The best concept was picked based on separation distance, convergence testing, time to reach the 1000 particles/second benchmark, and overall complexity. Concept 2 was the winner in terms of overall least complexity and highest separation distance.

            <h1 class="h2">02 : DFMA redesign on Toy Helicopter</h1>

              <p>This project and report was done for a course called "Design for Manufacturing". It incorporated 2 redesign methodologies and failure mode testing for a cheap dollar store toy in order to reduce assembly time and cost, while also reducing failure modes at the component level. This toy was picked due to it's low margins and simplistic design, as it's actually a cut down version of a remote control helicopter, but with an IR sensor using the user's hand as an input.</p>

              <p>After an initial survey of users describing the pros and cons of the product, and establishing its baseline requirements, the product was dissassembled and DFMA software by Boothroyd Dewhurst was used to visualize components that could be removed or integrated with other parts. The software also estimated cost of the original design, and while it was off due to external factors, it did give a baseline to compare to. You can find more about the software here: https://www.dfma.com/software/dfasoftware.asp. The manual redesign Lucas method was used to analyze the assembly in relation to handling and insertion, and as the product was dis-assembled and re-assembled several times, key parts that ruined design efficiency could be identified.</p>

              <p>Of course, removing parts just to save cost isn't enough, the product has to be checked for failure at the component level to make sure the removed parts don't hinder the product's functions. This was done by analyzing through Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), where the design is split into systems and it's subsequent components. There, one can analyze failure modes at the component level, choose the large failures from effects of failure mode based on their RPN value, and brainstorm viable solutions. After all that was said and done, different redesigns could be implemented based on the requirements compiled from user surveys, and the solutions from FMEA analysis.</p>

              <p>At the end of the project, assembly time and cost was reduced by 43%, while being 17% easier to assemble using the Lucas method. Not only was this project a great insight into efficient design thinking, but the report made me re-think a lot of the items I own and how they can benefit from redesigns. It also helped that I got an A on the paper, which you can read below.</p>

           <h2>03: Custom Enclosure - Mechanical Calculator</h2>
              <h3></h3>       
           <section>
        
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6"> 
            <p>In a world before computers, math functions were done in the mind. When humanity got bored of that, they invented mechanical calculators that used a series of dials, accumulator gears, and pinion wheels to help add or subtract large numbers, and for one of my manufacturing courses, re-designing an old model of those mechanical calculators was the task. Like with everything, we applied the engineering design methodology to identify shortfalls and come up with new ideas, while taking into account any constraints.</p>

            <p>But just designing it is child's play for a 4th year course, so to build a prototype we not only had limited resources, but had to show our work outside of CAD models. For example, we were given 3 identically sized MDF boards that had to be cut on a milling machine, shown in MasterCAM. But we only had a one sized spindle, meaning that to make small gears, the resolution was not enough for it to be made out of MDF and thus had to 3D printed and shown as an STL file.</p>

            <p>Overall it was a great project, and one of the things I hope to do again and get more experience with is making custom enclosures. The casing of the calculator that I made in MasterCAM needed to be divided into 3 MDF boards, as just one was not long enough. Connecting the front and back pieces together, with no interference with any of the gears, pinion wheels, or the cutout showing the dial was an amazing feeling after I finished the project. It made me appreciate how easy technology makes things, as the entire point of MasterCAM is to write G-code for complex procedures; a programming language used to instruct various machining tools.

           <h2>04: 2-stage gearbox</h2>
              <h3>A quintessential mechanical engineering project</h3>       
           <section>
        
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6"> 
            <p>This project was very self-explanatory, design a 2 stage gearbox and document all the important process plans. This took place over the course of the whole semester, so it allowed our group to apply the knowledge learned in the "Topics in Manufacturing Engineering" course as we learned it.</p>

            <p>The project started with first researching the appropriate manufacturing process for the gearbox, as we looked at 3rd parties that specialized in gearboxes and inquired about part sourcing/manufacturing. We also looked at the Machinery's Handbook to pick good materials for the given loads/torque the gearbox was meant to handle. Afterwards, a typical CAD model was made in Solidworks. </p>

            <p>But the project went further as it asked for specific manufacturing processes and tolerances, as not all the parts were COTS (it was assumed that we'd purchase the machinery to make the custom parts like the casing). This is where Geometric Dimension and Tolerancing (GD&T) was used to specify how accurate we'd want the parts to be, and how they should be made. GD&T is a system for defining/communicating engineering tolerances, and it's based on datums/reference points of the part that are crucial to it's function (the flatness of a brick for example is important as it dictates how level a wall is). Lastly, a process plan that showed how the part would be manufactured was also made, to reduce any errors or misconceptions at the shop. As always, you can read the full report here:</p>

        <h2>05: Gravity Powered Car</h2>       

      <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6"> 
           <p>Even though this project was done in high school, it costed our group a fair bit of money to make and design, and taught me a lot about working well with others.  I'd also say this project made me pursue engineering in the first place. This "gravity" car uses a falling mass's potential energy to turn a driveshaft and thus, move a car. It was done for an Advanced Placement Physics project, and like most high school projects, we had over-ambitious goals for this project to make it drive the furthest in a final competition. While most of the other groups were using wooden boards as their frame, we used styrofoam cut out like a surfboard to say that we at least considered aerodynamics. We tried to place the vertical boards holding the pulley and mass so the center of mass could be positioned near the rear axles to reduce overall weight transfer during acceleration. We even got custom wood boards cut using our school's woodshop to save on weight, but even with all of that, a day before the competition, the car just didn't work. </p>      
           <p>You see, what had happened up to now was that two of the group members had done the majority of the building, while the other member and I worked on calculations, dimensions, and the final report. Having learned little about group communication, we decided that even though the car didn't work we'd still meet together again a few hours before the competition. It didn't help because the other group member and I didn't know everything the other 2 had tried, and those other 2 members were already bummed out and had lost hope. Our car didn't move at all during the competition, and the 2 members who had spent time building it went out with a defeated look on their face. Our physics teacher, however, said that if we could get it to run by the end of the school day, he'd consider it when grading.</p>

        </div>
      </div>
    </section>
      
           <p>And that's when the other group member and I went to work. In about a half hour, when everyone else was at their lunch break, we went to the wood workshop, switched the wheel axles, adjusted the tension of the pulley, and tied down the mechanism connecting the hanging mass and the rear axle. The video below was our first attempt at making it move, and it's one of the single most satisfying moments of my life:</p>
           <center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cz2MeSpAISE" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center>
           <p>After that, I learned that one cannot disregard the importance of group communication. If we had kept each other up to date, one of us would've eventually saw the issue of why the car wasn't moving, and it's not to put down another's intelligence, but rather how one can be oblivous to simple solutions when stressed with over-ambitious goals. It's important to keep everyone in the know about the end goal, and having self-imposed constraints about weight or center of mass can sometimes make you forget about the basic systems that should be in check along the way.</p>

           <h2>06: Elastic Powered Car</h2>          
      <div class="container">
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6">
            <p>Compared to the previous project, this one went a lot better. Our group had some experience with engineering design from past courses, and knew the importance of group communication. This project was for a course called "Manufacturing Fundamentals", but making a car powered by elastic potential energy wasn't the main point. Designing it, accounting for tolerances as some parts had to be cut from an MDF acrylic board, understanding material strengths, gear ratios, etc were the main focus. Using engineering design we were able to identify different systems of the car, make a morphological chart to organize it, visualize concepts, evaluate the best one, and even make a prototype before going full scale. And because this project happened gradually over the semester, all of the group members were able to keep up with any new developments, and apply new information that was being taught on the side, like gear ratios and tolerance grades.</p>
            <p>The car worked by rotating a lever which would spin the elastic band connected to a thin paperclip connected to a small gear. When spun enough and let go, the elastic band would spin the small gear connected to a larger gear fixed to the rear axle, making the car move. This way, because of the gear ratios, the car had a lot of torque, which would help in the hill climb portion of the final race. The elastic band could also be attached to the larger output gear itself, causing a higher speed that'd be beneficial to the distance portion of the final test.</p>

            <p>We spent a lot of time on engineering calculations in relation to energy transfer, aerodynamic efficiency, and center of mass placement so we would do well in the race. Again, the final race consisted of a hill climb and distance test, and while we didn't end up winning first place due to a certain group member not winding the elastic enough, it still went better than the gravity car did initially. As always, you can read the paper for yourself, although note that the CAD models don't have some elements like the elastic band on it as it wasn't required for the report.</p>
