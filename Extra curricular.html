          <p>As much as I enjoyed attending lectures at 8:00AM during University, I probably won't remember anything from them in the future. What I will remember, is the people I met, and the experiences I had by applying my knowledge in real world applications, so it only makes sense that I mention my time in extra-curricular clubs.</p>

            <p>As a fan of F1 racing, I was drawn to RFR as it'd give me the workshop experience needed to understand power tools, manufacturing techniques (as many custom parts were used), and overall mechanical intuition in relation to different engineering systems interacting with each other. I was placed on the vehicle dynamics sub-team, and we were tasked with designing an anti-roll bar, but before that we were given presentations on different aspects of vehicle dynamics by the leads. The presentations were chapter summaries from old books such as "Race car vehicle dynamics", and eventually everyone on the sub-team gave a presentation about a chapter as well. Mine was on Vehicle Rates, which focused on longitudanal and lateral forces on the wheel, spring stiffness, and the workings of the almighty anti-roll bar. For those that don't know, an anti-roll bar reduces body roll of a vehicle during cornering by using the torque caused by an elevation change from one tire so the other tire can be the same elevation. This helps with handling and reduces weight transfer, and this bar can be strategically be placed to reduce under or over-steer.</p>

            <p>I actually did get around to designing an anti-roll bar using common off the shelf components (COTS) in Solidworks, for the purpose of using the simulation to calculate shearing and flexural stress when a load is applied, as well as deflections. It was designed within the work envelope, or free space at the rear axle. One could solve those calculations by hand/MATLAB using static analyzation, but that requires a fair bit of variables to input such as the elasticity of different materials. The 3D cad allows flexibility in using different parts and at different locations. However, due to the pandemic in 2020, the competition moved online, and the vehicle dynamics leads graduated, so my design never got past the simulation stage, as I quit the team shortly afterwards. My reason for leaving was just that I didn't feel connected working from home, and by the time things start to open up again, my graduation date came up. Still, it was a fantastic experience and I'd recommend other students to consider!</p>

            <p>RAD is one of my favorite clubs, and it's mainly due to my hobby of flying remote controlled (R/C) aircraft. In fact, my interest in it stems from my home country, as my childhood home was near a large international airport, and everyday I would see those planes fly in and out like majestic birds, and I knew that I'd have to one day figure out how to fly them for myself. Flying model R/C aircraft has been the fix for me for now, as I've even went out to get a Basic Drone Pilot Certificate so I can experiment with larger planes. Of course, one day I'd like to recieve a real pilot certificate, but back to the matter at hand.</p>


            <p>RAD is a student run team where they compete for SAE Aero, a design series competition for R/C aircraft. The competition has many criteria including Regular, Advanced, and Micro class, with different payload, time, and speed requirements. As they say on their website, the competition exposes participants to the nuances of conceptual design, manufacturing, system integration/test, and verification through demonstration, all very important skills I'd like to have experienced before graduating. I initially started off writing small MATLAB code in 2019 for small parameter calculations like takeoff speed and max thrust, and as being in mechanical engineering and not aerospace, I had to read up on technical definitions on my spare time. I got to work analyzing the final plane on software like XFLR5, which simulates airflow at low Reynolds numbers and gives important parameters like coefficient of drag or angle of attack on the wings. I also got to use Solidworks simulation to measure stresses and deflections on a bomb-bay door, which consisted of one servo with a metal linkage connected to a control horn. I even got to play a part in building the final plane in 2020, cutting different materials like fiber-glass or carbon fiber to epoxy onto the wing.</p>

            <p>As the competition grew, so did the duties of different sub-teams. For the 2021-2022 year, I was part of the structures wing/fuselage, and PADA team (Powered Autonomous Delivery Aircraft), where I worked on the mounting mechanism that held the main plane and the PADA (image on right). I was able to render them in Solidworks and run simulations for flexural/shear stress and deflection on key areas. I even got to make the mechanism using 3D Printing, though it never got tested on an actual flight due to other priorities. Still, I had a fantastic time in this club, and if you're reading this as a student thinking of joining, I highly recommend you do!</p>

            <p>Do I really need to explain why a mechanical engineering student would be interested in robotics? While it's not that automating simple tasks for a robot is exhiliratingly fun, I enjoy using physics-based analyzation to see how robot-manipulators can achieve things even the strongest person couldn't. As my specialty is in manufacturing, I figured the best people that know about automating, or at least simplifying processes in a workshop would be in robotics, so I'm hoping to learn more about data pipelines or analytics, manufacturing automation, and of course working well with a large team. </p>


            <p>R3 robotics competes in a contest called University Rover Challenge (URC), where students build remotely operated rovers that accomplish tasks that one day might be used on the surface of Mars. I was placed on a drone design team, which is a new part of the competition where drones are used for reconnaissance missions alongside the main rover. If you think from the RAD section, that as an aviation enthusiast with a basic drone pilot certificate, I'll excel at this, but that's not entirely true. I have designed a drone before using COTS parts, but haven't done any camera vision system programming. I did design a hexacopter (shown to the side), and took part in weekly meetings where we discussed other aspects of the URC, such as the power and suspension systems. </p>

            <p>While I did graduate before the drone part of the competition took place, I did meet a lot of younger people on the team who had ambitious ideas of their own, and I've been told that for 2023 they used my hexacopter design as a starting point. Overall, this team was a great way to meet new people, and was a great send off for my last year in engineering. </p>
