           <p>The lean six sigma course I did with Dr. Richard Chua was an online course through LinkedIn learning. It's essentially a business strategy that improves efficiency and quality within an organization, and tries to cut downtime. It can also be a personal state of mind, in which a worker always tries to focus on continuous improvement of their workplace.</p>

           <p>Even though the course I took doesn't offer a recognized certification from a third party, I'd consider myself a green belt; someone who understands the basic concepts, and can be part of a team and receive JIT training.</p>

           <p>I spend far too much time on Youtube than I care to admit here, but I actively want to participate in creating videos as a creative outlet. Normally my channel is filled with educational videos from my time in school, but I'd like to branch out to physical projects tacked with comedy. One of my first videos is a review of a wristwatch, done in the dry humor of Regular Car Reviews. Not only do I like wristwatches (collecting, modifying, etc) and cars (doing research on how it's internal systems operate, doing my own maintenance), but I love the unserious, campy style videos of RCR that are filled with cultural musings and existential detours, which translates so well in other sub cultures. This a type of video I don't see many people do, as it's sometimes difficult to balance comedy with technical reviews. </p>

           <p>I have ideas for other videos & plan to upload more (such as building an ArduPilot RC plane that follows an automated flight path, or reviewing a book I've read), and if you have ideas of what you'd like to see on my channel, then feel free to contact me about them! </p>

           <p>As mentioned elsewhere, I'm really passionate about aviation and flight, and even as a kid, I was drawn to remote controlled airplanes/helicopters/drones. It's one of the few hobbies that I still have interest in after all these years, and a large part of that is due to the output of creative Youtube channels. Channels like Flitetest, RCpowers, Samm Sheperd, rctestflight, and others have shown interesting experiments like tail-less gyro controlled flight, automating stunt flight paths, indoor fpv stunt videos, and more that I've experimented with myself. While it remains a niche hobby, I'd love to emulate these videos in my own Youtube channel someday. </p>
