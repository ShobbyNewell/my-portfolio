      <h2>In the name of efficiency,</h2>
      <p>This project was a culmination of two redesign methodologies, one based on software and the other done by hand, that aimed to reduce the assembly time and cost of a cheap infared toy helicopter. This toy was picked due to it's low margins and simplistic design, as it's actually a cut down version of a remote control helicopter, but with an IR sensor using the user's hand as an input.</p>

      <p>After an initial survey of users describing the pros and cons of the product was conducted to establish baseline requirements, the product was dissassembled and DFMA software by Boothroyd Dewhurst was used to visualize components that could be removed or integrated with other parts. The software also estimated cost of the original design, and while it was off due to external factors, it did give a baseline to compare to. The manual redesign Lucas method was used to analyze the assembly in relation to handling and insertion, and as the product was dis-assembled and re-assembled several times, key parts that ruined design efficiency could be identified.</p>

      <p>Of course, removing parts just to save cost isn't enough, the product has to be checked for failure at the component level to make sure the removed parts don't hinder the product's functions. This was done by analyzing through Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), where the design is split into systems and it's subsequent components. There, one can analyze failure modes at the component level, choose the large failures from effects of failure mode based on their RPN value, and brainstorm viable solutions. After all that was said and done, different redesigns could be implemented based on the requirements compiled from user surveys, and the solutions from FMEA analysis. 
      </p>

      <p>At the end of the project, assembly time and cost was reduced by 43%, while being 17% easier to assemble using the Lucas method. Not only was this project a great insight into efficient design thinking, but the report made me re-think a lot of the items I own and how they can benefit from redesigns. It also helped that I got an A on the paper.
