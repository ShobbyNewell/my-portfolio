           <h2>Summer Intern - Quality Oil Change and Tire Services LTD</h2>

            <p>This position came about a little unusually. This is during my first summer in University, and as I didn't have enough experience to get internships, I worked at storage warehouses to pay off my tuition. Things were going well, but I was not getting any relevant experience from my field of study, so I thought about positions that might get me to do that, and I landed on an auto-mechanic position. One of my father's friend owns an auto-body shop, and I asked him if I could work on Saturdays (as it's not a workday so he could use the help if short-staffed).  </p>

            <p>He agreed, and I got to work on simple maintenance of cars such as oil changes, brake/rotor replacement, wheel alignment, etc. Needless to say, I also got experience with power tools, such as impact wrench and power tools. I grew a bond with the employees, and even though I wasn't good at everything (I especially sucked at removing tires from rims using the manual machine), they were willing to show me the ropes. The owner even offered discounted oil changes for my car, but I couldn't accept. Before I parted, he wrote me a letter of recommendation, which you can see below.</p>

           <h2>Team member - Artistree of Canada</h2>
              <h3>2021 - June to August</h3>       
           <section>

            <p> Artistree is a sub-brand of Micheals, an art's and crafts store, and they specialize in custom picture frames among other custom printings. I was originally going to be working as a Joiner here; one who uses a joining machine that connects two sides of a picture frame to be fixed using V-nail wedges. These two sides just beforehand are cut to specification by a saw operator, so I was essentially working in a manufacturing cell of sorts. My title was changed to Team member as they needed someone to do QC checks, scanning, and sorting within that manufacturing cell, so I got to experience almost all the company had to offer, even if it was a temporary position.</p>

            <p>Note that I have worked before at storage warehouses also as temporary positions, usually as a general assistant, but I list this one only because I believe it fits most description of "Machine Operator", as it involved performing QC/QA checks, monitoring processes, being briefed about safety protocols, troubleshooting issues with equipment, and giving feedback to supervisors on potential issues. </p>
