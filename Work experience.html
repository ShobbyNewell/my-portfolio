           <h2>Summer Intern - Quality Oil Change and Tire Services LTD</h2>
              <h3>Summer 2018</h3>

          <div class="col-md-6"> 
            <p>This position came about a little unusually. This is during my first summer in University, and as I didn't have enough experience to get internships, I worked at storage warehouses to pay off my tuition. Things were going well, but I was not getting any relevant experience from my field of study, so I thought about positions that might get me to do that, and I landed on an auto-mechanic position. One of my father's friend owns an auto-body shop, and I asked him if I could work on Saturdays (as it's not a workday so he could use the help if short-staffed).  </p>

            <p>He agreed, and I got to work on simple maintenance of cars such as oil changes, brake/rotor replacement, wheel alignment, etc. Needless to say, I also got experience with power tools, such as impact wrench and an air grinder. I grew a bond with the employees, and even though I wasn't good at everything (I especially sucked at removing tires from rims using the manual machine), they were willing to show me the ropes. The owner even offered discounted oil changes for my car, but I couldn't accept. Before I parted, he wrote me a letter of recommendation, which you can see below. Overall, this job helped me think about the maintenance life cycle of complex machines like cars. It also encouraged me to do my own car maintenance, which has helped save me lots of money.</p>

           <h2>Team member - Artistree of Canada</h2>
              <h3>Summer 2021</h3>       
           <section>

          <div class="col-md-6"> 
            <p> Artistree is a sub-brand of Micheals, an art's and crafts store, and they specialize in custom picture frames among other custom printings. I was originally going to be working as a Joiner here; one who uses a joining machine that connects two sides of a picture frame to be fixed using V-nail wedges. These two sides just beforehand are cut to specification by a saw operator, so I was essentially working in a manufacturing cell of sorts. My title was changed to Team member as they needed someone to do QC checks, scanning, and sorting within that manufacturing cell, so I got to experience almost all the company had to offer, even if it was a temporary position.</p>

            <p>Note that I have worked before at storage warehouses also as temporary positions, usually as a general assistant, but I list this one only because I believe it fits most description of "Machine Operator", as it involved performing QC/QA checks, monitoring processes, being briefed about safety protocols, troubleshooting issues with equipment, and giving feedback to supervisors on potential issues. </p>

        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-6"> 
            <p> At IPEX, I oversaw extrusion lines of PVC pipes (mostly electrical conduit). This included packing and labelling orders, as well as taking a random sample and performing measurement and quality checks every hour. I also helped the quality control technicians by reporting deficiencies (such as high raw material usage), and help start or shut down a line when a certain order was filled.</p>

            <p>I learned a fair bit about manufacturing, quality control, and safety systems in this position, as well as other industries that use these pipes, such as in construction or sewer systems. </p>

            <p>This is my current position - Repair Service Representative. John Crane manufactures mechanical seals, which are used to keep fluid separated between rotating and stationary devices, primarily in pumps and compressors. Working in repair, I oversee used seals come in for service, and we get them cleaned and machined. It's then inspected around the sealing areas using engineering drawings, and if everything passes, it's sent out to be assembled and shipped. Sometimes we're asked to provide an observation report to find out why the seal failed, or assist the application engineers with failure reports (which include taking photos and reviewing pump service data). I also deal with customers who bring in competitor seals, and we're asked to provide a suitable John Crane replacement based on pump measurements, speed, temperature, and pressure of the fluid.</p>
